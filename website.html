			This website is going to be a collection of all of my programming creations. To start it off, the wesite itself if my first website. Feel free to check out the source code if you are intersested, or care, or some other reason, I don't really care... My intentions for this site is for it to be a collaberation of all of my coding creations. I will just add what ever I make to the file and to the end of the page. I will also be adding things that I use and find very usefull or interesting.

			As a challenge in Computer Science 1, I had to solve the problem <em>send + more = money</em>, and I was really craving to code something because we had not been coding in the class yet. So  I decided to use Python 3.x, and solve the problem like that. After the program ran for about 45 mins, it spit out the answer: <em>9567 + 1085 = 10652</em>!

			Select the link below to play a game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" that was written in Javascipt! It generates a random number between 0 and 1. Depending on the number generated depends on what the computer plays, so don't worry, it is not rigged against you. The scorekeeper on the right of the table is still a work in progress and does not work. If the results does not change, then the same outcome from before happened and the page updated, you just could not see it.

			This is my favortie coding text editor. It has a large community, and a lot of great plugins for most of the languages. No it does not have compilers, but it has great themes and programming assitance. Yes it has auto-complete with most languages, but here are my thoughts on that. People say that it is cheating when you use auto-completes, but I feel like you still need to know the name of it, and also what it is going to do to your code. You are not pointing and clicking, you are just making your coding more efficient, thats all.

			I have found Stackoverflow very useful when it comes to getting stuck on a bug when coding. The community is large, and people are most of the time just there to help out others, because who does not love a good challenge? If anyone ever needs a second pair of eyes on a problem they have, I strongly recommend Stackoverflow. Just click on the picture above and you can go straight there!
